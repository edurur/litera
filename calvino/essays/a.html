<p>The Good Reader looks forward impatiently to his vacation. He has
saved a certain amount of reading that interests him for the solitary
weeks he’ll spend at the beach or in the mountains, and he can already
taste the joy of siestas in the shade, the rustling of pages, surrender
to the fascination of other worlds exuded by densely printed pages.</p>
<p>As the holidays approach, the Good Reader tours the bookshops,
browses, sniffs, has second thoughts, returns the next day to buy; at
home he takes down from the shelf volumes whose pages are still uncut
and lines them up between the bookends on his desk.</p>
<p>It’s the time when the mountain climber dreams of the peak he’s
getting ready to scale, and the Good Reader, too, chooses which mountain
to take on. For example, it could be one of the great nineteenth-century
novelists, of whom we can never say we have read their entire oeuvre, or
whose mass has always somewhat awed the Good Reader, or whose works,
read at different times and at different stages of life, have left
fragmentary memories. The Good Reader has decided that this summer he
will really, finally, read that author; maybe he won’t be able to read
everything during the vacation, but he will lay down a base of
fundamental readings, and then, during the year, he’ll be able to fill
in the gaps easily, in a leisurely way. So he acquires the works he
intends to read, in the original language if it’s one he knows,
otherwise in the best translation; he prefers the large volumes of the
collected-works editions, but he doesn’t dislike paperbacks, which are
better for reading on the beach or under the trees or on the bus. He
adds some good essays on the chosen author, or maybe a correspondence:
there, now he has solid company for his vacation. It can hail the whole
time, his holiday companions can turn out to be hateful, the mosquitoes
may be intolerable and the food inedible: the vacation will not be
wasted, the Good Reader will return enriched by a new imaginative
world.</p>
<p>This, obviously, is only the main course, now he has to think of the
side dishes. The Good Reader wants to keep up with the latest bookstore
offerings; then, there are new publications in his professional field,
and it’s crucial to take advantage of these days to read them; he also
has to choose some books that are different from the ones he’s already
chosen, to provide variety and the possibility of frequent
interruptions, repose, and changes of tone. Now the Good Reader has
before him a very detailed reading plan, for all occasions, hours of the
day, moods. If he has a house available for his holidays, maybe an old
house full of childhood memories, what could be better than to have a
book for every room, one for the porch, one for the bedside, one for the
chaise longue?</p>
<p>It’s the eve of departure. He’s chosen so many books he’d need a
trunk to transport them. The job of exclusion begins: “This one I won’t
read anyway, this is too heavy, this isn’t urgent,” and the mountain of
books crumbles, is reduced to half, to a third. Now the Good Reader has
reached a selection of essential readings that will lend tone to his
vacation. As he packs his suitcases some volumes are left out. Thus the
program comes down to a few books, but all substantial; these holidays
will represent an important stage in the Good Reader’s spiritual
evolution.</p>
<p>The days of vacation begin to pass swiftly. The Good Reader finds
himself in excellent shape for sports, and stores up energy to get into
the ideal physical situation for reading. After lunch, however, he’s so
drowsy that he sleeps all afternoon. He has to react, and here the
company—unusually pleasant this year—helps. The Good Reader forms many
friendships, and morning and afternoon is out in the boat or off on a
tour, and at night is carousing until late. Reading, of course, requires
solitude; the Good Reader thinks up a plan to get away. Cultivating his
attraction to a blonde might be the best option. But with the blonde he
spends the morning playing tennis, the afternoon at canasta, and the
evening dancing. In moments of leisure, she is never silent.</p>
<p>The holiday is over. The Good Reader puts the untouched books back in
the suitcase, thinks of autumn, of winter, of the rapid, concentrated
quarters of an hour granted to reading before he goes to sleep, before
rushing to the office, in the tram, the dentist’s waiting room . . .</p>
