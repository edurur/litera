**Family:** Neith was the mother of [Ra](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/rl6cct/the_god_ra/), [Shu](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/rjri1f/the_god_shu/), [Ihy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/s3l20c/the_god_ihy/), and [Sobek](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/rk8ck3/the_god_sobek/), and the creator of [Apophis](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/rejkca/the_demon_apophis/).  She was sometimes considered to be the wife of [Khnum](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/s38jdp/the_god_khnum/) or [Set](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/rf5jvl/the_god_set/).


A very ancient creator goddess, Neith guarded the deceased, and made sacred warriors’ [weapons](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/y3lttr/weapons_in_ancient_egypt/).  Neith was originally worshiped as an ancient war goddess, who led the charge in battle.  She had a special significance for warrior kings and their wives.

Neith was called “the Eldest, the Mother of the Gods, who shone on the first face.”  Neith was by far the favorite deity acknowledged in the personal names of the earliest dynasties, for she appears in almost 40 percent of all theophoric names.  The [pharaoh](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/s5ru1w/the_pharaoh/) Nectanebo II claimed Neith as his mother.

A text in the Roman Period temple of Esna describes how Neith created the world by speaking seven magical words.  On the wall of the Temple of [Khnum](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/s38jdp/the_god_khnum/) at Esna, we see Neith emerging from the primeval waters as a [cow](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/r2f06p/cattle_in_ancient_egypt/)\-goddess who creates land by simply saying the words: “Let this place be land for me.”  

The other deities acclaim Neith for having “separated for us the bright dawn from the night, made for us a ground upon which we may take support, and distinguish for us the units of time in the space of an instant.” 

Everything Neith conceived with her heart came into being, including thirty gods, and then she went on to create the sun-god [Ra](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/rl6cct/the_god_ra/), who himself created mankind.  During her festival a statue of the goddess Neith was placed in the sunlight, to reunite her with her son.  The statue was then sailed down the river on a boat shrine, as celebrants danced and feasted.

Neith was thought to be the mother of every [pharaoh](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/s5ru1w/the_pharaoh/), and a text dating from the 6th century [B.C.E.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/rbw5lk/egyptian_terminology/) states that it was she who invented birth.  Plutarch says her temple (of which nothing now remains) bore the inscription: “I am all that hath been, and is, and shall be; and my veil no mortal has hitherto raised.”

Despite being a goddess and mother, Neith was considered to be so powerful that she was described as androgynous, two-thirds of her person being male, and one-third female.  Amulets of Neith, made of [gold](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/u4qry7/gold_in_ancient_egypt/), [faience](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/uzcssw/faience_in_ancient_egypt/), and [lapis lazuli](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/ul9w6b/lapis_lazuli_in_ancient_egypt/), were popular.

As “The Highest Judge,” Neith was thought to help judge the dead in the [Duat](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/rcya6p/duat/).  “Judgment has been made in the presence of Neith” was a common refrain from the Coffin Texts.  In the “Contendings of [Horus](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/s8ce74/the_god_horus/) and [Set](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/rf5jvl/the_god_set/)” Neith appears as a wise counselor to whom [Ra](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/rl6cct/the_god_ra/) himself appeals for help, though her aggressive nature is seen in her threat that she will grow angry and make the sky fall to the earth if her advice is not followed.

It was in the funerary mode that Neith was depicted at her most fierce, shooting [arrows](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/zr8kco/the_bow_and_arrow_in_ancient_egypt/) at the [demons](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/reiikx/demons_of_ancient_egypt/) that would attack the deceased, either in the tomb or during the passage through the [Duat](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/rcya6p/duat/).  During the earliest times, [weapons](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/y3lttr/weapons_in_ancient_egypt/) were placed around the grave to protect the dead, and so her nature of a warrior-goddess might have been a direct link to her becoming a mortuary goddess.

Neith was also known as a goddess of weaving and the domestic arts, and she was said to have woven the world on her loom.  As the divine patron of weavers, the [linen](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/t8hoc8/flax_and_clothing_in_ancient_egypt/) wrappings of the [mummy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/rjghwn/mummies_and_mummification_in_ancient_egypt/) were produced by the “Weavers of Neith” - bandages were the "Gifts of Neith."  Thus Neith protected the dead in yet another way.  She was called the "Seamstress of the Cloth of Life, whose thread is [gold](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/u4qry7/gold_in_ancient_egypt/), whose needles are fire."

A great festival, called the Feast of Lamps, was held annually in her honor, and according to Herodotus her devotees burned a multitude of lights in the open air all night during the celebration.  Lamps, torches, and tapers were set in every corner of the house, burning until dawn.  In a single room in the Temple of Neith the remains of fifty-eight lamps have been found.

Tiny boats made of [papyrus](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/r35qbv/the_papyrus_in_ancient_egypt/), carrying candles, were floated on Neith’s sacred lake.  Herodotus claims that an image of the goddess in the form of a kneeling [cow](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/r2f06p/cattle_in_ancient_egypt/) with the sun disk between its horns was carried in public procession, covered by a purple robe.

Neith’s sacred animal was the [click beetle](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/rzfed0/the_click_beetle_in_ancient_egypt/) – her most ancient symbol was a [click beetle](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/r48km0/insects_and_arachnids_of_ancient_egypt/), sometimes over two crossed [arrows](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/zr8kco/the_bow_and_arrow_in_ancient_egypt/).  Protective [golden](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/u4qry7/gold_in_ancient_egypt/) amulets of [click beetles](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/rzfed0/the_click_beetle_in_ancient_egypt/) have been found.  The cult of Neith is so ancient that the Egyptians themselves forgot that the symbol of Neith represented a [beetle](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/r48km0/insects_and_arachnids_of_ancient_egypt/), for later in history this central image was interpreted as a [shield](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/yo0ndr/the_shield_in_ancient_egypt/).  The image of the insect is clear on the early objects, however.

Neith was also associated with the [honeybee](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/r21wig/the_honey_bee_in_ancient_egypt/) and her temple in the town of Sais was known as *Per-bit* ("House of the Bee.")  Neith was thought to be the protector of the canopic god [Duamutef](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/rehx24/canopic_god_duamutef/).  A myth states that the serpent [Apophis](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/rejkca/the_demon_apophis/) came into being when Neith became angry and spat into the primeval waters of [Nun](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/ryrd3s/the_god_nun/).

Neith was pictured as a woman wearing the [Red Crown](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/tclowj/red_crown/), sometimes holding a [bow and arrows](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/zr8kco/the_bow_and_arrow_in_ancient_egypt/), a woman with the head of a [lioness](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/rbh88t/the_lion_in_ancient_egypt/), or as a [cobra](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/r4clk1/the_cobra_in_ancient_egypt/), a [Nile Perch](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/r2t2hp/fish_in_ancient_egypt/), or a [cow](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/r2f06p/cattle_in_ancient_egypt/).  Sometimes Neith was shown as a woman nursing a baby [crocodile/s](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/r4hnd2/the_crocodile_in_ancient_egypt/) (her son, the [crocodile](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/r4hnd2/the_crocodile_in_ancient_egypt/)\-god [Sobek](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/rk8ck3/the_god_sobek/).)  One of her titles was “Nurse of [Crocodiles](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/r4hnd2/the_crocodile_in_ancient_egypt/).”  In rare instances Neith was pictured with a [crocodile’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/r4hnd2/the_crocodile_in_ancient_egypt/) head.

In the eleventh hour of the night Neith appears in four forms – as a child, as a queen of [Upper Egypt](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/rbx772/upper_and_lower_egypt/), as a queen of [Lower Egypt](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/rbx772/upper_and_lower_egypt/), and as a pregnant goddess.  There is evidence of an [Osiris](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/rvmnfm/the_god_osiris/)\-like cult of a woman dying and being brought back to life that was connected with Neith.

The Greeks identified Neith with their own goddess of war and wisdom, Athena.

An inscription on a statue of Udjahorresne states: "I let His Majesty know of the greatness of Sais, the seat of Neith-the-Great, the Mother who bore [Ra](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/rl6cct/the_god_ra/) and inaugurated birth when birth had not yet been.  The King came to Sais and went in person to the Temple of Neith.  He made a great prostration before Her Majesty, as every king has done.  He made a great offering of every good thing to Neith-the-Great, the Mother of God, as every beneficent king has done.  His Majesty did this because I had let His Majesty know the greatness of Her Majesty Neith, that she is the Mother of [Ra](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/rl6cct/the_god_ra/) herself."

A papyrus scroll dating to the Ptolemaic Dynasty says: "Come to Sais in order that you may see your mother Neith.

Good child, you shall not be separate from her!

Come to her breasts that have abundance in them.

Good brother, you shall not be separate from her!

Come to Sais, your city!

Your place is in the mansion shrine, you shall rest beside your mother forever!

She will protect your body, she will drive away your enemies, she will be your protection forever!

O good sovereign, come to your house, come to Sais!"
